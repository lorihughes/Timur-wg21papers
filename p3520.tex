\section{Specify the mode of termination}

The current wording in \cite{P2900R11} says that if a contract violation occurs while evaluating a contract assertion with the enforce or quick-enforce semantic, "the program is terminated in an implementation-defined fashion".

According to CWG, this specification is insufficient to determine which modes of termination are conforming. CWG is asking to enumerate the specific modes of termination that a conforming implementation is allowed to choose between.

The following modes of termination exist in C++ today (ordered by severity):
