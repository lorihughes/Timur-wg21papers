\section{Introduction}

Some people are concerned that a new codepath might result if an \emph{implicit} precondition --- a precondition attached by the implementation to a core language expression, as proposed in \cite{P3081R1}, \cite{P3100R1}, and \cite{P3329R0} --- is violated and the contract-violation handler exits via an exception.

This paper addresses that problem by requiring that the \emph{default} contract-violation handler does not exit via an exception. Thus, the new code path will not happen without an explicit replacement of the contract-violation handler by the user, which means it cannot happen inadvertently by accident or as the result of a port to a conforming implementation.

Note that this restriction can always be relaxed in a later iteration of C++ as a non-breaking change, but it cannot be so added.

\section{Proposed wording}

The proposed wording is relative to \cite{P2900R13}.

Modify [basic.contract.handler], paragraph 1 as follows:

\begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
The \emph{contract-violation handler} of a program is a function named \mbox{\tcode{::handle_contract_violation}}. The contract-violation handler shall take a single argument of type ``lvalue reference to \tcode{const} \mbox{\tcode{std::contracts::contract_violation}}‚Äù and shall return \tcode{void}. The contract-violation handler may have a non-throwing exception specification. The implementation shall provide a definition of the contract-violation handler, called the \emph{default contract-violation handler.}\added{ The default contract-violation handler shall not exit via an exception.}
\begin{note}
No declaration for the default contract-violation handler is provided by any standard library header.
\end{note}
\end{adjustwidth}

\section{Summary}

By adding this one line of wording, we eliminate a stated concern, and leave open all options moving forward. It is anticipated that this proposal will increase consensus, as it has no obvious or likely negative consequences.
